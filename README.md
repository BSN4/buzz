# 👨‍🚀 buzz
Attempt to make a small/lightweight typed scripting language written in Zig

# Goal
- Small in size and complexity (just a bit more than Lua though)
- Strict typing
- Unambiguous
- No nonsense coercion
- TBD: coroutines?

# TODO
- [ ] 16 bytes instructions (at least to not be limited to 255 constants, globals, locals, etc.)
- [ ] Register based op codes like lua?

# Resources
