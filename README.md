Attempt to make a small/lightweight typed scripting language written in Zig

# Goal
- Small in size and complexity (just a bit more than Lua though)
- Strict typing
- Unambiguous
- No nonsense coercion
- TBD: coroutines?

# TODO
- [ ] 16 bytes instructions (at least to not be limited to 255 constants, globals, locals, etc.)
- [ ] Register based op codes like lua?
- [ ] Object properties/methods by index instead of name

## Objects
- [ ] Add special array of palceholders in ObjectCompiler
- [ ] If inside object declaration, create property/method placeholders in that array
- [ ] We know at resolving if they should be a method or a property
- [ ] When we finished parsing object, if placeholders are still there, migrate them to globals

### this?
- If we don't use this to refer to properties/methods of current object: add `OP_GET_PROPERTY`/`OP_SET_PROPERTY` as fourth option in `namedVariable`

Placeholder in globals = slot in globals array
Placeholder in object = named slot in properties hash map
