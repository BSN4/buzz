# buzz
(temporary name) attempt to make a small/lightweight typed scripting language

# Goal
- A small scripting language but with strict typing and with the primary goal to avoid any ambiguity both for the programmer and the compiler.
- Close integration with the system (maybe having it be a candidate for shell scripting?)
- Easy string manipulations
- Could run in a VM at first, and then target LLVM (but how to do GC then?)

# Ideas
- Use http://c9x.me/compile/doc/il.html ?
